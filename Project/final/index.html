              <h1>About This Project</h1>  
                <p>When I was young, it was usually up to me to cook for myself after getting back from my part time job
                    in the
                    afternoon while my parents were working. While this wasn’t what gave me my love for cooking, it did
                    instill
                    it as a valuable skill for me. It was only as I got older that I really grow to appreciate it as a
                    skill I
                    wanted to improve on; however, by that point I had moved out and didn’t have much to work with. By
                    the time
                    I really wanted to get better at cooking, I had downgraded from a full kitchen, to only an electric
                    burner
                    and a convection oven, and without the luxury of picking out whatever ingredients I wanted from the
                    store.
                    But I still loved cooking, so I worked with what I had, and I realized that no matter the budget, it
                    is
                    always possible to make great food. And I would like to share some of that here.</p>

                <summary>Disclaimer</summary>
                <p>While I enjoy cooking I am in no way a professional. This is a hobby I enjoy, and I have picked some
                    things up, but I don’t know it all. If anything I have to say contradicts the way you like to do
                    things, pay it no mind. I’m doing this to share my experiences.</p>
