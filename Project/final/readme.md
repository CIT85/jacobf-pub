# My P1 Website
* For my project I decided to go with a cooking themed website. I asked chat GBT for 30 ideas (I am working on a college project and I need to make a website. give me 30 ideas), and in a couple of them it touched on cooking, and while its ideas weren’t exactly what I had in mind, it felt like something I could work with. Cooking is a big part of my life, and is something I get genuinely excited about, so working on something to share what I’ve picked up sounded like a fun idea. I tried to get some ideas from Chat GBT on how to flush out the idea (I like the idea of a cooking theme, help me flush that out), but it starting giving suggestions more advanced than I would be ready to try, and after asking it to simplify its ideas, I started thinking that I could probably handle that part myself, as it’s ideas were a little too vague to be helpful; I figured I could always come back if I needed help with anything more specific.
